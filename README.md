# Programmer-Home-Page
This is a home page for programmers made for a hackathon coding competition based on the theme of productivity

## Purpose
This is a website that I am making so that I can use to get to work on my projects

## Editing
You can edit the HTML file to change links and images if you really want to(I would recommend you just take out the images just because it can take a while)

## Responsiveness
This page is not yet responsive to smaller screens but will hopefully be fixed soon
